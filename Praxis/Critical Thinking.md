"using reasoning, evaluating evidence and thinking carefully about the process of thinking itself" (Chatfield, 2018 p. 6)

Scepticism - refuse to take at face value, ask about reliability
Objectivity - set aside emotions and feelings, find facts

Scepticism without trust and objectivity
- Conspiracy theories
- flat earth and white genocide

A priori - just makes sense, or can be logically deduced
Authority - A source is believed to be inherently truthful
Tradition - Historical precedent
Scientific method

Belief vs Knowledge
- Knowledge is provisional and contestable
	- only best understanding at this point in time
