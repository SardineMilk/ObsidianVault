Logical Connectives
-  NOT = "It is not the case that"
-  AND = no temporal connotations, just glues two sentences
-  OR = Always inclusive - X OR Y = X, Y, X+Y
-  XOR = Exclusive - A XOR B = A, B
- If A then B  - Material Implication. Birthday $\implies$ Cake (If it is my birthday I always eat cake. I may also eat cake when it is not my birthday.)
- A if and only if B - A iff B


To define these logical connectives, I shall use [[Truth Tables]]

Symbols (Get proper symbols after lecture)
- AND:  $\land$
- NOT: $\lnot$
- OR: $\lor$
- XOR: $\oplus$
- Implication: $\implies$
- Biconditional: $\iff$
