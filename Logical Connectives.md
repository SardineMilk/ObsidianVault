Logical Connectives
-  NOT = "It is not the case that"
-  AND = no temporal connotations, just glues two sentences
-  OR = Always inclusive - A $\lor$ B = A, B, A+B
-  XOR = Exclusive - A $\oplus$ B = A, B
- Iff = If and only if
- Implies = Material Implication. 

**Example: Implies**
Birthday $\implies$ Cake 
If it is my birthday I always eat cake. I may also eat cake when it is not my birthday.
This statement is only false if I do note eat cake on my birthday

**Example: Iff**
Birthday Party $\iff$ Birthday
I will only ever have a birthday party on my birthday.
This statement will be false if I have a birthday party not on my birthday.
This statement will be false if it is my birthday, and I don't have a birthday party.

To define these logical connectives, [[Truth Tables]] can be used

When used in a propositional statement, the following hierarchy can be used to limit brackets:
> ¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔

Not, And, Or, Implies, Iff (with left being used first)

This is similar to BODMAS in arithmetic
