Logical Connectives
-  NOT = "It is not the case that"
-  AND = no temporal connotations, just glues two sentences
-  OR = Always inclusive - X OR Y = X, Y, X+Y
-  XOR = Exclusive - A XOR B = A, B
- If A then B  - Material Implication
- A if and only if B - A iff B


To define these logical connectives, I shall use [[Truth Tables]]

Symbols (Get proper symbols after lecture)
- AND: A with bar missing
- NOT: corner, mirrored r
- OR: v, flipped AND
- XOR: + inside O
- If A then B: ->
- A iff B: <->
