### Exercise 1
Problem Space Of:
#### MyHWU portal
- Show all services accessible in a clear and concise manner
- Allow easy navigation between services
- Should show where to find further information and services
- Should be usable on mobile and desktop
- People are using it with a specific goal going in.
	- people aren't just 'checking my portal', they want to find and access a specific service
	- This is an assumption

#### Canvas
- Access course material easily
- People often just want to see any new and important information
	- assignments due/new
	- assumption
- Not see any irrelevant info from other campuses
	- We don't need to see info from Dubai
	- This may require a large change in the underlying code?
- Homepage is currently very cluttered
	- "Smart Search" shouldn't be prioritised over "Assignments" in the sidebar
- General sloppy design which needs extra quality control
	- When switching to "Course Analytics", the word "hello" flashes briefly on the screen
- Primarily used by Heriot Watt students

### Exercise 2

Obsidian - Note Taking Software

Obsidian uses a folder and file design. Files are pages of text stored inside one or multiple folders
Plugins - extra add-on software, which you 'plug in' to the software
Patches - updates that fix small bugs, like a puncture repair kit
Vault - All notes are stored in a vault, which is fully secure, due to being plain-text and local
Second Brain - The graph visualises links between your notes, which (according to the marketing) mimics the structure of the human brain and how it thinks
Calendar - Shows one month at a time, and you flip between pages like a physical calendar. This allows easy visualisation of planned tasks.

obsidian is based on a framework very familiar to people who have used systems like vscode during school
obsidian arranges their folders in a way that is very easy to read to anyone who uses any kind of side file manager (not like discrete file managers) like how ides or text editors indent and have collapsability


### Exercise 3

Metaphors:
Icons visually resemble their use
The scroll bar is a visual representation of how far down the page you are
Icons are setup in a tiling format which makes it easy for us to understand because we understand that each thing takes up a slot, think how everyone knows how tetris or windows work.

It is not a good design:
Cluttered
unintuitive
hides important information 
Confusing where to find resources
Bad visual design 
- horrid shade of lime green
Very hard to personalise on mobile
- Very difficult to scroll without moving an icon
After customising, the page doesn't automatically refresh, meaning you have the old design until you manually refresh the page.

There is no purpose for smart search as it takes the same amount of time to find things using smart search as it does regularly. Futhermore, a lot of sections can be condensed together aka People -> Discussions or Files -> Collaborations. # insert where you please in the canvas rant section  
The Groups section should also be scrapped since you can find your groups inside courses and all it does is clutter the sidebar

"the portal seems confusing to uderstand where to find the resorces needed"

The portal automatically includes boxes which are completely irrelevant for some students, meaning that some boxes are a waste of space:  
- Postgraduate resources are shown for undergraduates.  
- International student advice is shown for home students.  
  
The portal also sometimes uses two boxes for a singular use case, when they could just be condensed to one. One example is how there are multiple boxes just for 'enquiries.'
