#### Exercise 1

One thing that violates Don Norman's design principles is the myHWU portal app, specifically the mobile version. The app has many buttons linking to different services, several with identical icons. On desktop these are accompanied by titles, but mobile has no other information. For example, the "Timetable" and "Calendar" buttons both have a calendar as an icon and no title, meaning they are identical. This violates the Visibility principle, as the user cannot tell what a button will do by looking at it.

Canvas violates the Constraint principle. There are many unnecessary features on the main screen that could be placed in a drop-down context menu. This causes information overload and makes it difficult to find important information on the site. For example the Smart Search feature is placed above important sections like Announcements, Assignments and Modules. This clogs the toolbar, when it could easily be integrated into the search bar with minimal disruption. Other features on the same toolbar can also be condensed, such as Assignments & Quizzes, People, Collaborations & Discussions, and Grades & Course Analytics. This would lead to a much more concise and streamlined experience, with only necessary information displayed for each course on it's home page. 

#### Exercise 2
left to right
- Arabic 7-up can has stylised the logo to still read "Seven Up" when read right to left

language sizes 
- different scripts take different amounts of space in the design
- some words are longer in different languages

Cultural connotations of colour
- western cultures associate red with danger, china does with luck
- funerals - black in western cultures, white in eastern

Culture impacts many aspects of interface design. A large factor is left-to-right vs right-to-left reading. This will impact the way a user approaches the entire interface, and will require a new design from the ground up to accommodate. 
Another factor that has to be considered is the size of the same words in different languages. For example, you may need to allocate more space for a text container when translating to German. This can have cascading effects on a design. A website would have to deal with formatting both small English words in the English version, whilst also trying to fit in the longer words from other countries and vice versa
A small factor that may have large impacts is the cultural connotations of different colours. A culture that associates green with danger would have a different reaction to a green button than one that associates it with safety. For example, in western cultures black is used for mourning, while many eastern cultures use white instead. If for example you had a "STOP!" page on your website when a user was about to do something they could not reverse, in China that may read as "this is good" until they actually read the text - which they may not do. ON the other side, western cultures would immediately read it as bad and stop


#### Exercise 3

Don Norman believes that culture doesn't have a large impact on design in the modern world. as evidence he shows the homogenity of globalised designs from mega-corporations such as Apple and Google.
However, we don't agree. Culture still is important in design, but the sheer market dominance of the corporations and their mass-produced products can out-compete local, custom designed products.  
His arguments partly apply to software and UI as well. Companies try to maintain a cohesive design language across all versions of their software, leading to a more homogeneous digital environment than the early days of the internet. However, they still make edits where the impact of doing so outweighs the cost, both of the work to make the change and of the impact to the brand's recognizability. For example, most companies will make their Arabic sites read right-to-left. His arguement that the philosophy will remain the same as it is the same group of people teaching it will still apply
