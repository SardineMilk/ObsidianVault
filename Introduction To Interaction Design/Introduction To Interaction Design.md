# End Goal = Get Money


Where do we start?
- Ask users about current experiences
Gives a clear understanding of "how" and "why" before writing code
- saves time and money
It is harder to change design after committing it to code
- more on this in [[Prototyping]]

Its better to investigate, plan and design before jumping into programming
