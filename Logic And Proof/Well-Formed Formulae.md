Valid statements in PL are known as Well-Formed Formulae (wff).
Wff are defined by the following rules:

1. All atoms are wff
2. If X and Y are wff, so are all combinations of X and Y formed by [[Logical Connectives]]
3. All wff are constructed by repeating rules 1 and 2 a finite number of times

Any wff that aren't [[Atomic Statements]] are known as [[Compound Statements]]

$\vdash$
If a wff is **always true**, it is called a [[Tautology]] $\top$
If a wff is **always false**, it is called a [[Contradiction]] $\bot$
If a wff is **true at least once**, it is [[Satisfiable]]
- Ex: Given a formula, determine whether it is satisfiable or not
	- use a truth table, find if any output is true
