Propositional Logic (PL) is a formal language. It is composed of [[Atomic Statements]], linked together by [[Logical Connectives]] (aka Propositional Connectives) into [[Compound Statements]].

> A statement that cannot be analysed further using the propositional connectives is called an *atomic statement* or simply an *atom*. Otherwise a statement is said to be *compound*. The truth value of a compound statement can be determined once the truth values of its atoms are known by applying the truth tables of the propositional connectives.

> We now define the formal language called propositional logic. This consists of a set of symbols called atomic statements or atoms [...] from which we construct well-formed formulae (wff)

Formulae in propositional logic are also known as [[Well-Formed Formulae]]
