[[Propositional Logic]](PL)
- "Artificial Language"
- Boolean Algebras (BL)
	- Circuit Design 
	
- First Order Logic (FOL)
	- Around 1/4 of time in class
	- Alan Turing

Statements
- A sentence that is capable of being either true (T) or false (F)
- Don't use 1/0 except in BL
- AKA propositions

[[Logical Connectives]]

Logical statements can be displayed with:
- [[Truth Tables]] - Showing all possible inputs and outputs
- [[Parse Trees]] - Showing graphical structure of statement

Logical Constants:
Bold T/F are always True/False - in handwriting, they're underlined
**T**
**F**

PL is the logic of elementary decision making

Semantics is what languages mean (elaborate later)
